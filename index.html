            greatly contributed to the missile projects namely 'Agni' and

            Missile Man of India. He was a scientist in the Indian Space

            Passed Away on 27 July 2015, aged 83, while delivering a lecturer at
            Indian Institute of management Shillong, Due to an apparent cardiac
            arrest. We have lost great son of India who Dedicated his entire
            life to the welfare of his motherland. His life and work proved to
            be an inspiration for millions of people across the world. His life
            history is and always will be an encouraging story to all the
            aspiring youthsAlmost every day he used to come to my shop, sit on
            this bench and talk for at least half an hour. He also used to get
            his chappal repaired regularly," says George, who was overwhelmed
            when the President stopped by and asked him in Tamil: "George,
            Eppidi irikk? Saukhyamaa" (How are you, George? Are you fine)?"
            George was so numbed by the excitement that all he could do was to
            nod a yes. The President's visit to Thiruvananthapuram was an
            emotional trip down memory lane. Among the visitors he received was
            Parameswaran Nair who owns the Guruvayurappan Lodge. And, as is his
            wont, he gave his NSG security team a heart attack by stepping down
            from the stage and running into the audience which comprised his
            ex-colleagues and friends. Kalam appeared oblivious of the security
            and the rain.
